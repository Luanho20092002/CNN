# CNN
CNN with only Numpy  
I used only 4 filters in convolution layer.  
You should change the parameters to get the better accuracy.  
This is the result after training the model.  

Epoch 0  [==========]  loss: 0.3018, accuracy 36.36%  
Epoch 1  [==========]  loss: 0.2434, accuracy 50.35%  
Epoch 2  [==========]  loss: 0.1780, accuracy 77.62%  
Epoch 3  [==========]  loss: 0.1367, accuracy 83.92%  
Test accuracy 59.00%
